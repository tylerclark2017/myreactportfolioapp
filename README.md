# myreactportfolioapp

## Description
This application, a portfolio application built using React, was meant to teach us how to further utilize all of the fundamentals of React that we learned throughout the unit, as well as further our knowledge of the React dependencies necessary to run a successfully built React application. We also had to create a style sheet for the application in order for it to be as visually polished as possible. I used Coolors and the Adobe Color Wheel to pick out some appealing, matching colors that worked well together for the styling. 

## Disclosures
I utilized the following resources to complete this project: the Xpert Learning Assistant, Chat GPT, my tutor Erik, and had some additional help from our instructor Louis in order to finalize everything in my project. Erik was incredibly helpful, and I made sure to include most all of the dependencies listed in the React units package.json files to ensure proper functionality--starting of course with the react-router-dom dependency listed on the Challenge criteria.
